### Performance
- **Optimization**: Model quantization, pruning, distillation
- **Deployment**: Docker containers, cloud deployment scripts
- **Benchmarking**: Comprehensive evaluation on different datasets

## 📝 Code Style

### Python Code
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use Black for code formatting: `black .`
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for all functions and classes

### Documentation
- Update README.md for new features
- Include docstrings with examples
- Add comments for complex algorithms

### Testing
- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass: `pytest`
- Include integration tests for end-to-end workflows

## 🔧 Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2. Make your changes
3. Run tests: `pytest`
4. Format code: `black .`
5. Check linting: `flake8`
6. Commit changes: `git commit -m "Add your feature"`
7. Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
8. Create a pull request
